## About DormMatch
Hi! I'm Chetan Gorantla, the developer of DormMatch. I'm a high school senior (likely attending UT Austin for Computer Science in the fall) passionate about CS, and I built this website to help incoming freshmen at the University of Texas at Austin. **DormMatch** is designed to assist students in choosing a dorm/residence hall that fits them best. My goal is to make choosing your on-campus housing easy, so I hope you find my website useful!

## Features
- **Web Scraping Data Extraction**: Used BeautifulSoup to retrieve relevant data from the UT Austin housing page.
- **Dorm Rating System**: Determine a score that each dorm recieves based on your inputted necessities/amenities.
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Predicts which dorm provisions align best with your amenities requested.

## Contact
Feel free to check out [DormMatch](https://www.dormmatch.net) and let me know your thoughts! Reach out to chetangorantla7@gmail.com with any questions.
Futher development may continue to expand the reach to more college campuses, like Texas A&M, UMICH, UIUC, etc.
